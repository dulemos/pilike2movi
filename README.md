## What is this?

Trying to build and API to Movidesk

## How I'm doing it?

- Reading the [Movidesk Api Documentation](https://atendimento.movidesk.com/kb/pt-br/article/256/movidesk-ticket-api) and implementing test first and than the code.
- Priorizing everything that the docs says that is mandatory.

## How to run it?

I've discover [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and I'm loving it, so I've decided to use it in this projet.

For now all you can do with this projet is to run tests, for it navegate into this
repo root folder and type ` pipenv run pytest`
